# MM 2017 HW 3.

## Speed Calculations w/ R.


__Task 1: Analyze Spot Speed Data.__

Write an R script to complete the following: 

- Calculate the mean and standard deviation of speeds for two data sets
- Determine whether speeds calculated using procedure 1 are higher than 25mph at significance 0.05
- Conduct significance tests on the mean of procedure 1 & 2
- Regress speeds measured by procedure 1 against procedure 2


__Task 2: Relationship b/w Time-Mean-Speed & Space-Mean-Speed.__
- Use the speed data provided to validate the relationship between time-mean-speed and space-mean-speed
