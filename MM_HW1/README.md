__Task 1: Invesitage data set using R.__

Write an R script to answer the following questions: 

- What are the dimensions of the data set and what are the variable or column names? 
- What are the maximum actual travel time and maximum historical travel time? 
- What is the actual travel time variance for the measurement in each hour? 
- In which five-minute interval do you find the maximum difference to be between the actual and the historical
travel times? Create a simple plot to show the difference in each five-minute interval. 
- Regress actual travel time on historical travel time, and show the regression results.
